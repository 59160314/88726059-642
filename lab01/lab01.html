<h1>Gold Tracer</h1>

<p>Bleed buildup is 40 per strike<br />
<br />
With a bleed effect of 300, the Gold Tracer is a vicious weapon in PVP.<br />
Its decent damage rating and continuously fast strikes induce a nasty blood loss in only a matter of seconds.<br />
<br />
When equipped in the left hand, instead of a parry (L2) and single attack (L1),<br />
the right handed strong attacks are used instead (L1 is the first attack, and L2 is the follow up attack).<br />
This makes it effective to off-hand while using a Greatbow, Ultra Greatsword or other large, slow weapons,<br />
as it allows for a faster attack against an enemy who comes too close and the user has no time to swing the main weapon or fire an arrow.
